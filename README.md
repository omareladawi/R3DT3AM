# Red Team Operations and Simulated Attack 
Objective

This project focuses on executing a simulated attack on a network environment using red team methodologies to evaluate and enhance incident response capabilities. Through strategic planning, exploitation, persistence, and reporting, we aim to simulate real-world adversarial tactics and assess security resilience.

# Project Phases

1️⃣ Planning and Reconnaissance
Develop an engagement plan, define attack scenarios, and gather intelligence on the target environment.
Deliverables: Reconnaissance report, attack plan.

2️⃣ Initial Compromise and Pivoting
Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access, escalate privileges, and pivot laterally within the network.
Deliverables: Documentation of successful exploitation and movement.

3️⃣ Maintaining Access and Persistence
Deploy backdoors, scheduled tasks, and stealth mechanisms to ensure continued access.
Deliverables: List of persistence techniques and evidence of undetected presence.

4️⃣ Reporting, Security Enhancement, and Presentation
Provide a detailed report on findings, attacker behavior, and security improvement recommendations.
Prepare a final presentation summarizing the engagement.
Deliverables: Red team engagement report, security enhancement plan, final presentation.

# Why This Matters
By simulating real-world cyber threats, this project provides a comprehensive security assessment, identifying weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. The goal is not just to break defenses but to fortify them through informed security strategies
